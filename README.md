Project to learn and mess about with models in Rails.
Completed with help from TheOdinProject.com

There is no front-end designed with this project so no live version.

Goal: 

To learn how to generate and manage models including the associations between them to leverage the rails framework.

Observations: 

Was fun to actually get to play with models. Would have loved to have built a front-end for it, but I'm sure I'll have plenty of chance to do that with upcoming lessons. 

Loved getting to know the generations that rails can do and learning multiple ways to setup the belongs_to with doing it in the migration file, or through the generation, or just slapping it onto the model files. Was hard to see the versatility of things in the readings but when you actually do it a few different ways it sinks in.
